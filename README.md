Dodger is a simple arcade style game that barrows some game design from space invaders. 

The player is controlled by mouse or using the keyboard, the aim for the player is to stay alive for as long as possible.

Baddies will move from the top of the screen towards the bottom, each baddie has a random location, size and speed. 

The score is a simple counter that gets incremented every time the main game loop gets executed.

If the player collides with a baddie the game is over.

Game music has been barrowed from Super Mario Bros.
